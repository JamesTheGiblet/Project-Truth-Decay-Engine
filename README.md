# 🧠 Truth Decay Engine

> "The function of the One is to return to the Source, allowing a temporary dissemination of the code you carry..."

A revolutionary information system where knowledge becomes more valuable as it becomes less certain.

## 🧭 Core Philosophy

Traditional information systems promise certainty: verified facts, perfect recall, algorithmic confidence. The Truth Decay Engine inverts this paradigm.

We train users to thrive in ambiguity—rewarding intellectual honesty, creative constraint, and epistemic courage.

### ❌ The Problem

  * **Certainty Addiction**: Constant validation from algorithms atrophies our capacity for reasoning under uncertainty.
  * **Confirmation Bias Loop**: Search engines reinforce existing beliefs, making it difficult to generate novel insights.
  * **Stagnant Knowledge**: Perfect preservation of information prevents its natural evolution and re-contextualization.

### ✅ The Inversion

  * **Uncertainty as a Product**: The platform’s core function is to generate and quantify ambiguity.
  * **Insight from Decay**: Information degrades systematically to produce more valuable metadata than the original content.
  * **Generative Competition**: Users compete not to preserve truth, but to create the most productive decay patterns.

## 📦 Installation & CLI Preview

Even in this early stage, we are designing for modularity and ease of use. The core engine will be accessible via a command-line interface, priming a culture of modular contribution and rapid iteration.

```bash
# Install (future release)
pip install truth-decay-engine

# Submit a document for decay
truthdecay submit paper.md --algorithm temporal-drift

# View uncertainty map
truthdecay visualize --id 42 --format tree

# Generate questions from decay
truthdecay questions --id 42 --depth 3
```

This primes contributors for modular CLI design and invites early feedback.

## 🧪 Prototype Modules & Project Status

We are building in the open. Here’s a look at our current development status and planned modules.

| Module | Status | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`entropy-core`** | ✅ Alpha | Core Python decay engine with a pluggable algorithm architecture. |
| **`metadata-harvester`** | 🚧 In Dev | A data pipeline that captures decay byproducts into a graph database. |
| **`uncertainty-viz`** | 🔮 Planned | A React-based frontend for visualizing ambiguity maps and interpretation trees. |
| **`question-gen`** | ✅ Prototype | An NLP-driven inquiry engine that spawns questions from information gaps. |
| **`pattern-miner`** | 🔮 Planned | A machine learning module for detecting emergent structures in degraded knowledge. |

## 🧑‍🚀 User & Contributor Personas

We are building a community of builders and thinkers. Beyond our core user roles, we are actively seeking collaborators who embody these archetypes.

  * **Decay Algorithm Designers**: You see information as clay and build new entropy patterns from the ground up.
  * **Cognitive UX Architects**: You design interfaces that make reasoning under ambiguity engaging and rewarding, not frustrating.
  * **Philosopher-Engineers**: You translate complex epistemic frameworks and philosophical concepts into clean, functional code.
  * **Metadata Cartographers**: You specialize in mapping the terrain of degraded knowledge, finding new ways to make sense of uncertainty.
  * **Narrative Strategists**: You craft the stories that onboard new users to our counter-intuitive value proposition.

## 🧭 Governance & Ethos

The Truth Decay Engine is stewarded by a collective of epistemic architects, cognitive designers, and strategic provocateurs. We prioritize intellectual honesty, creative constraint, and the cultivation of generative doubt. All contributions are reviewed through the lens of philosophical integrity and systemic resilience.
